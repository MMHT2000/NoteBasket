# NoteBasket

## Project Overview

**NoteBasket** is a premium note-sharing platform designed to offer students access to high-quality study materials through a subscription-based model. Users can choose from three subscription levels: **Free**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. Only Admins and NoteMasters are authorized to upload notes, while users can access them based on their subscription level.
